**Abstract Programming Interface for Robotics**, or **APIR** for short, is a collection of tools that helps robotics students accomplish their robotics project!

# Features
- It has classes for sensors which has useful functions for it
- Portable
- Easy to use
- Easy to adapt

# Using the Library
- Install the .ZIP file from the [releases](https://github.com/QuadraBoy/APIR/releases) page.

- If you have Arduino IDE, go to **Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library**

- And finally, locate the .ZIP file you've just downloaded and select it.

# History
It all started when we were finishing our robotic research project. My classmates keep asking me how to use this, how to use that, and how I can fix this. And this inspired me to make a collection of tools that help my classmates or even other robotics students finish their projects.

# Project Status
**The project is still in development**. I plan adding more features and refractoring the code. Feel free to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/QuadraBoy/APIR/pulls) if you want to request a feature!
